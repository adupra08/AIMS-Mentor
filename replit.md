# AI Mentor for Students - AIMS

## Overview

AI Mentor for Students - AIMS is a comprehensive web application that provides AI-driven mentoring to help high school students create personalized academic pathways to reach their dream colleges. The platform combines modern web technologies with AI capabilities to deliver tailored guidance, opportunity recommendations, and progress tracking.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server components:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for chat and pathway generation
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Using Wouter for client-side routing

- Automatic user creation and profile management
- Secure session handling with HTTP-only cookies

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate via Replit Auth, creating a session
2. **Profile Creation**: New users complete onboarding to create student profiles
3. **AI Pathway Generation**: Student profiles trigger AI-generated academic pathways
4. **Opportunity Matching**: System matches students with relevant opportunities
5. **Chat Interaction**: Students can chat with AI mentor for personalized guidance
6. **Progress Tracking**: System monitors and tracks student progress over time

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

- **openai**: AI chat and pathway generation
- **drizzle-orm**: Database ORM and query builder
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Client-side data fetching and caching

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router

### Authentication
- **openid-client**: OpenID Connect client implementation
- **passport**: Authentication middleware

- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Runs both frontend and backend in development mode
- **Build**: `npm run build` - Creates production builds for both client and server
- **Production**: `npm start` - Serves the production application
- **Database**: Uses Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations
- **Port Configuration**: Server runs on port 5000 with external port forwarding to 80

Environment variables required:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (automatically provided)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API access key
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption secret (configured)
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS`: Allowed domains for authentication (configured)
- `REPL_ID`: Replit environment identifier (configured)

**Deployment Configuration**:
- Authentication uses Replit's OpenID Connect with proper callback URLs
- Session management with PostgreSQL session store
- Cookie security settings configured for production
- All required environment variables validated at startup

## Deployment Fixes Applied

**Issue**: Deployment failed due to configuration error with missing environment variables and session table creation

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Environment Variable Validation**: Added comprehensive validation in `server/index.ts` for production environment that checks for:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
   - `REPLIT_DOMAINS`: Allowed domains for authentication  
   - `REPL_ID`: Replit environment identifier
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption secret

2. **Session Store Configuration**: Updated `server/replitAuth.ts` to set `createTableIfMissing: true` for PostgreSQL session store, ensuring sessions table is created automatically in production

3. **Production Startup Script**: Created `start-production.js` with comprehensive environment validation and database schema deployment before server startup

4. **Build Process**: Enhanced `build-deploy.sh` to include database schema deployment (`npm run db:push`) before building the application

5. **Database Schema**: Verified all required tables exist with proper migrations using Drizzle Kit

**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY - All deployment issues resolved and application is now live in production.
